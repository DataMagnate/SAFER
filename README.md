# SAFER
Agents for Good 

This project explores how multi-agent GenAI can strengthen the financial resilience of low-income households by combining conversational guidance, risk detection, and proactive early-warning signals. By pairing specialist agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation grounded in validated financial protection protocols, the system delivers safer, clearer, and more actionable advice on budgeting, borrowing, and fraud prevention. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can be used responsibly to support vulnerable households, assist frontline workers, and give policymakers better insight into financial stress patterns across communities.
